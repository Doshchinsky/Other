## Warehouse of random (and sometimes) useful files and scripts :)



### Note for .bashrc:
Copy or move it at your home (~/) dir and type in terminal `source ~/.bashrc`.
After that you will be able to use all of mine aliases, e.g. use `src` instead of `source ~/.bashrc`.
For GitHub aliases you should run script in, located in the same repo, `gitaliases.sh`


### Note for gitaliases.sh:
Firstly, give rights on execution to the script with `chomd +x ./gitaliases.sh`.
After that you can run simply it as `./gitaliases.sh`


##### Star and Share if you like it :D
