## Warehouse of random (and sometimes) useful files and scripts :)



### Note for .bashrc:
Copy or move it at your home (~/) dir and type in terminal `source ~/.bashrc`.
After that you will be able to use all of mine aliases, e.g. use `src` instead of `source ~/.bashrc`.
For GitHub aliases you should run script in, located in the same repo, `.gitaliases.sh`


### Note for gitaliases.sh:
Firstly, give rights on execution to the script with `chomd +x .gitaliases.sh`.
After that you can run simply it as `./gitaliases.sh`


### Note for .repoupdate.sh:
With this shell-script you can update whole your repositories in one command.
Firstly, give rights on execution to the script with `chomd +x .repoupdate.sh`.
Place this script in the folder with your repos and run it (`./.repoupdate.sh`).


### Note for .postinstall.sh:
This script designed to fix errors, which occurs while using rEFInd instead of the standart GRUB.
Firstly, give rights on execution to the script with `chomd +x .postinstall.sh`.
Now after every core-update you need to run this script (`./.postinstall.sh`).
Also check out `.bashrc` file to get usefull alias for Arch-Linux core update.
